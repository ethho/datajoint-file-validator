# Outreach Plan

Broad engagement with the neuroscience community is necessary for the optimization,
integration, and adoption of the Resource components.

We conduct five types of outreach activities that require different approaches:

## 1. Precursor Projects

Our [Selection Process](../selection) requires a "Precursor Project" for any new
experiment modality to be included in DataJoint Elements. A precursor project is a
project that develops a DataJoint pipeline for its own experiments either independently
or in collaboration with our team. We reach out to teams who develop DataJoint
pipelines for new experiment paradigms and modalities to identify essential design
motifs, analysis tools, and related tools and interfaces. We interview the core team to
learn about their collaborative culture, practices, and procedures. We jointly review
their open-source code and their plans for dissemination. In many cases, our team
already collaborates with such teams through our other projects and we have a good
understanding of their process. As we develop a new Element to support the new
modality, we remain in contact with the team to include their contribution, solicit
feedback, and evaluate design tradeoffs. When the new Element is released, a full
attribution is given to the Precursor Project.

**Rationale:** The Resource does not aim to develop fundamentally new solutions for
  neurophysiology data acquisition and analysis. Rather it aims to systematize and
  disseminate existing open-source tools proven in leading research projects.

## 2. Tool Developers

DataJoint pipelines rely on analysis tools, atlases, data standards, archives and
catalogs, and other neuroinformatics resources developed and maintained by the broader
scientific community. To ensure sustainability of the Resource, we reach out to the
tool developer to establish joint sustainability roadmaps.
