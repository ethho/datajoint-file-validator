# Dissemination Plan

## 1. Dissemination

We conduct activities to disseminate Resource components for adoption in diverse
neuroscience labs. These activities include

- A central [website](https://datajoint.com/docs/elements/) for the Resource.
- Conference talks, presentations, and workshops
- Publications in peer-reviewed journals
- White papers posted on internet resources and websites
- On-site workshops by invitation
- Remote workshops and webinars
- Online interactive tutorials hosted on GitHub Codespaces
  - [DataJoint Tutorials](https://github.com/datajoint/datajoint-tutorials)
  - [DataJoint Workflow Array
    Ephys](https://github.com/datajoint/workflow-array-ephys#interactive-tutorial)
  - [DataJoint Element Calcium Imaging](https://github.com/datajoint/element-calcium-imaging#interactive-tutorial)

## 2. Community Survey

In order to measure the effectiveness of the Resource, we conduct several activities to
estimate the adoption and use of the Resource:

- A citation mechanism for individual components of the Resource.

     | Resource | RRID |
     |:---------|:-----|
     | DataJoint Core | [RRID:SCR_014543](https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_014543) |
     | DataJoint Elements | [RRID:SCR_021894](https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_021894) |

- GitHub forks and dependent repositories.

- A register for self-reporting for component adoption and use (see [DataJoint Community
  Survey](https://try.datajoint.com/communitysurvey)).
